## Hands-on Labs Scenario
In this hands-on lab, you will deploy existing demo application i.e. ACME FITNESS Store application written in Java, Python, and C# to Azure using Azure Spring Apps Enterprise (ASA-E). You can simply execute Spring Boot and polyglot applications on Azure with ASA-E. After you're done, you can either switch to Azure Portal or continue managing the application using the Azure CLI.

## Lab Context
Throughout this hands-on lab, you will learn several things:

- Build and deploy both frontend and backend Spring applications to Azure Spring Apps.
- Configure Single Sign-On (SSO) for the application using Azure Active Directory.
- Create persistent stores (PostgreSQL and Azure Cache for Redis) outside the applications and connect those applications to those stores.
- Use Azure Key Vault to securely store and load secrets to connect to Azure services.
- Monitor applications using Application Insights and Log Analytic Workspace.
- Updating the source code of the application and the spring application.
- Use Spring Cloud Gateway filters to apply rate limiting to your API.
- Automate provisioning and deployments using GitHub Actions.
